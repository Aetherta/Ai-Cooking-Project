# Your computer is now a chef of questionable quality

We're teaching an AI model to cook, if the results are edible is.. undetermined, for now.

I will be training the model on a wide variety of parameters.
To ensure your reciepies are coherent, please use the master branch only. 
If you wish to generate some odd results, feel free to play around with the other branches


IMPORTANT: Before running any promopts, make sure the training module is commented out, otherwise
the notebook will replace the previously generated model and train it again.


Enjoy
